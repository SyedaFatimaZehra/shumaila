        <h2>What is Thalassemia?</h2>
        <p>Thalassemia is a genetic blood disorder characterized by the bodyâ€™s inability to produce sufficient hemoglobin, which is essential for carrying oxygen in the blood. This condition leads to a reduced number of red blood cells and can cause anemia.</p>
        <p>Thalassemia is inherited and can vary in severity from mild to severe, impacting the quality of life of those affected.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Types of Thalassemia</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Alpha Thalassemia:</strong> Caused by a deficiency in the alpha globin chains of hemoglobin. It can lead to various forms, such as Alpha Thalassemia Minor and Hemoglobin H disease.</li>
            <li><strong>Beta Thalassemia:</strong> Caused by a deficiency in the beta globin chains of hemoglobin. It includes Beta Thalassemia Minor and Beta Thalassemia Major (Cooley's anemia), which is more severe.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>Thalassemia is diagnosed through blood tests that check for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hemoglobin levels</li>
            <li>Blood cell counts</li>
            <li>Hemoglobin electrophoresis to identify abnormal hemoglobin types</li>
        </ul>

    <section>
        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatment options for Thalassemia may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Regular blood transfusions to maintain hemoglobin levels</li>
            <li>Iron chelation therapy to remove excess iron from the body</li>
            <li>Bone marrow or stem cell transplant for severe cases</li>
            <li>Medications to manage symptoms and complications</li>

        <h2>Living with Thalassemia</h2>
        <p>Living with Thalassemia can present unique challenges, but many individuals manage the condition effectively with proper care and support. Thalassemia is a genetic blood disorder that affects hemoglobin production, leading to anemia and other health complications. Patients often require regular blood transfusions and may undergo iron chelation therapy to manage excess iron in the body.

            Despite these challenges, individuals with Thalassemia can lead fulfilling lives by adhering to treatment plans, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and receiving support from healthcare professionals, family, and community resources. Education about the condition and proactive management are key to thriving with Thalassemia.</p>
